# PXL Scripts Overview

Pixie utilize PxL (Pixie Language) scripts. To learn more about PxL, take a look at our documentation [here](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/pxl).

## Contributing

If you want to contribute a new PxL script, please discuss your idea on a Github [issue](https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/issues). Since the scripts are exposed to all community users there is a comprehensive review process.

You can contribute a PxL script by forking our repo, adding a new script then creating a pull request. Once the script is accepted it will automatically deploy once the CI process completes.
